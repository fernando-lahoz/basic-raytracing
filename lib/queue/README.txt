This subproject implements a generic thread-save bounded queue based on the one
given for the PSCD(21-22) subject TP6 project.

The BoundedQueue class was originally implemented by the subject teachers
in October of 2018, although it has been slightly modified.

The concurrent wrapper class was implemented by team number 5, but has
also been adapted to be generic.
